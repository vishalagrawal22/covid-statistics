# Covid Statistics

## Introduction

This project is a static site with the following features:-

1. Live covid statistics of the whole world
2. Covid statistics based on user location (country and state both).
3. Covid statistics of any particular Country and State.

## APIs Used
1. https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/covid-193
2. https://rapidapi.com/axisbits-axisbits-default/api/covid-19-statistics
3. https://locationiq.com/geocoding (reverse geocoding)

## Extra Info
1. Covid-19-statistics API has a latency of 1s, so segments might take time to load
2. Covid-19-statistics API doesn't instantly update their data, so the data displayed in the second and third sections is two days older than the current date.
